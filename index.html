        <p>The orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) is a small, critically endangered parrot native to southern Australia. Measuring around 20 cm in length, this parrot is known for its vibrant green plumage and distinctive orange belly patch. It is one of the few parrot species that migrate, breeding in Tasmania and wintering on the southern coast of mainland Australia. The orange-bellied parrot primarily feeds on seeds and berries from coastal grasses and shrubs. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species, which faces significant threats from habitat loss and other environmental pressures </p>
