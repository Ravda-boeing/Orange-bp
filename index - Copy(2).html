        <h1 style="text-align: center;"> What is the Orange bellied parrot</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"> And why is such a big deal?</h3>
        <p>The orange-bellied parrot is quite special for several reasons:
        <br>
            1. <b>Critically Endangered**: It is one of the world's most endangered birds, with a very small wild population. Conservation efforts are crucial to prevent its extinction.
         <br>   
            2. <b>Migratory Behavior</b>: Unlike most parrots, the orange-bellied parrot is migratory. It breeds in Tasmania and migrates to the southern coast of mainland Australia during the winter.
         <br>   
            3. <b>Distinctive Appearance</b>: This small parrot is known for its vibrant green plumage and a distinctive orange patch on its belly. Males are generally brighter than females.
          <br>  
            4. <b>Unique Habitat</b>: It primarily inhabits coastal and sub-coastal areas, preferring saltmarshes, heathlands, and grassy areas. This specific habitat requirement makes it vulnerable to habitat loss.
          <br>  
            5. <b>conservation Efforts</b>: Significant efforts are being made to save this species, including captive breeding programs and habitat restoration projects. These efforts are vital to increase the population and genetic diversity.
